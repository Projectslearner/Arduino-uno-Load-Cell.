### Weight Measurement with HX711 Load Cell and Serial Monitor

#### Project Overview

This project measures weight using an HX711 load cell and displays the result on the Serial Monitor. The system can be calibrated to ensure accurate measurements.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Module**
3. **Load Cell**
4. **Jumper Wires**
5. **Push Button (for calibration reset)**

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the DT pin of the HX711 to analog pin A0 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the SCK pin of the HX711 to analog pin A1 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the push button to digital pin 2 on the Arduino for calibration reset.
   - Connect the load cell to the HX711 module according to the module's specifications.

2. **Initialize Serial Communication:**
   - Start serial communication with a baud rate of 9600 to enable communication between the Arduino board and a connected device (e.g., computer).

3. **Calibrate the System:**
   - In the setup phase, the system is calibrated by taking an average of 100 readings to establish a baseline.
   - Place a known weight (e.g., 100g) on the load cell and wait for the calibration process to complete. This sets the calibration factor for accurate weight measurements.

4. **Measure Weight:**
   - Continuously read values from the HX711 load cell and calculate the weight based on the calibration factor.
   - Display the calculated weight on the Serial Monitor.

5. **Reset Calibration:**
   - Use the push button connected to pin 2 to reset the calibration. This allows you to recalibrate the system if needed.

6. **Adjust Delay:**
   - Adjust any delays in the `loop()` function according to your needs to control the rate of weight measurements and updates.

#### Applications

- **Weighing Systems:** Use this setup to create accurate weighing systems for various applications, such as kitchen scales, baggage scales, and more.
- **DIY Projects:** Integrate weight measurement capabilities into your DIY projects, enabling them to respond to changes in weight.
- **Educational Purposes:** Use the setup to illustrate concepts related to load cells, weight measurement, and calibration in educational settings.

#### Notes

- Ensure the load cell is securely mounted and properly connected to the HX711 module to get accurate readings.
- Customize the calibration factor based on your specific load cell and the weight used during calibration to improve accuracy.
- Experiment with different weights and calibration techniques to achieve the best results for your specific application.
